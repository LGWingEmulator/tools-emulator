MOTIVATION

Running storage benchmarks inside of the emulator raise some concerns that time
might not be reported correctly in the guest.  This benchmark is intended to be
run on an Android device with time measurement done on the host.

USAGE

1) Start an x86 Android emulator
   (must have at least 1024MB of free internal storage space)
2) Disconnect any other devices/stop any other emulators
3) ./android-bench.sh

It is also possible to run this benchmark on Linux for comparison
1) ./linux-bench.sh
